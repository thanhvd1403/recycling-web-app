## Tree-Planting & Awards Presentation Ceremonies

“As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Clean and Green Singapore, it is timely to reflect on how making Singapore clean, green and sustainable can continue to strengthen us as a nation and as a society.“ – Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat

To kick off the CGS Launch Event, Guest of Honour, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, together with Minister Desmond Lee, Minister Grace Fu and Mayor of North East District, Mr Desmond Choo, planted a Magnolia Champaca tree. Senior Minister of State, Dr Amy Khor, Minister of State, Mr Desmond Tan, Mayor South West, Ms Low Yen Ling and Mayor North West, Mr Alex Yam concurrently planted a White Chempaka and Golden Gardenia tree. These trees are known for their fragrant flowers and were planted to create a therapeutic and relaxing environment within the campus.

<u>Message by DPM Heng Swee Keat</u>

DPM Heng highlighted how Singapore has been transformed into a highly liveable and sustainable city in the years since independence, and shared that keeping Singapore clean has become more important as personal hygiene and public cleanliness are key lines of defence against COVID-19. DPM encouraged everyone to play their part in making Singapore more sustainable, as efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future will not only improve our living environment, but also help to grow the economy, generate more businesses and create good green jobs.
